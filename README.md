## Project Overview
The main objective of this competition is to analyze the given data, explore relationships between features, and develop a model to make predictions based on the processed dataset. The notebook explores feature correlations, visualizes data distributions, and builds a machine learning model to meet the competition's objectives.

## Dataset
Details about the dataset and its contents:
- **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded and initially explored to understand the features and target variable.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, scaling, and other transformations.

Note: Ensure you have access to the dataset files as they may not be included in this repository.

## Requirements
The primary libraries required for this project are:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `phik` (for advanced correlation analysis)
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`

You can install all requirements with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy phik scipy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UznetDev/Competition-for-NT-4th-month.git
    cd Competition-for-NT-4th-month
    ```

2. Install the dependencies listed above.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Notebook Structure
The notebook follows a structured workflow, outlined as follows:

1. **Setup and Imports**: Imports necessary libraries and sets up the environment.
2. **Data Loading**: Loads the dataset, explores the structure, and checks for missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering and Correlation Analysis**: Uses `phik` and other correlation measures to identify important features.
4. **Visualizations**: Visualizes feature distributions and correlations.
5. **Model Training**: Trains a predictive model and evaluates its performance on the dataset.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance metrics to gauge its effectiveness in solving the competition's problem.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook `Competition_for_NT_4th_month.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run each cell step-by-step to reproduce the analysis and model training.
3. Modify parameters and experiment with different models to improve performance.
